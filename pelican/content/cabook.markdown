Summary: A practical approach to better software design

I'm excited to announce that the success of [the post on clean architectures](/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/) encouraged me to expand the subject and to write a book that I titled "Clean Architectures in Python. A practical approach to better software design".

The book will be published on Christmas Day 2018, and will contain a complete introduction to TDD and clean architectures, two topics that I believe are strictly interconnected. So far the book is 170 pages long and it is complete, at least for a first edition, but I am already planning to add content that could not fit in this release for several reasons (mostly because still unclear in my mind).
