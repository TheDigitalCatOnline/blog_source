Summary: A practical approach to better software design

**UPDATE**: version 1.0.3 is out! Some readers unsurprisingly spotted typos and bad grammar and were so kind to submit fixes.

I'm excited to announce that the success of [the post on clean architectures](/blog/2016/11/14/clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example/) encouraged me to expand the subject and to write a book that I titled "Clean Architectures in Python. A practical approach to better software design".

The book contains a complete introduction to TDD and clean architectures, two topics that I believe are strictly interconnected. The book is 170 pages long and it is complete, at least for a first edition, but I am already planning to add content that could not fit in this release for several reasons (mostly because still unclear in my mind).

The book is available for free [on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python). If you enjoy it, please tweet about it with the `#pycabook` hashtag.

So far 2,762 readers downloaded the book, and 64 readers contributed with money. Thank you all!
