Summary: A practical approach to better software design

I'm excited to announce that the success of [the post on clean architectures]({filename}clean-architectures-in-python-a-step-by-step-example.markdown) encouraged me to expand the subject and to write a book that I titled "Clean Architectures in Python. A practical approach to better software design".

So far more than 14,000 readers downloaded the book. Thank you all!
