Title: About

## About me

I'm mainly interested in open source software and work (mostly) only with it both at office and in personal life.

I like both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, so my interests are spanning a wide area; just to name the most important ones: operating systems internals, versioning, Python programming, software architecture.

I am currently working at [TRE srl](http://treuropa.com) in the field of satellite remote sensing, developing C and Python scientific applications for massive radar data processing.

## About this blog

This blog grows out of my desire to publish again a series of old articles on concurrent programming I wrote at the university to summarize some knowledge acquired during the operating systems class. The first articles you will find here, thus, are derived from that early work.

Here you will however find a large degree of topics, since many are my interests in the field of computer science (and elsewhere too, but you will not find them here). Cats are curious animals: so the title implies this is blog about curiosity in the digital world.

## License

The content of this blog is the result of my studies and investigations into different computer science topics. Nothing could ever have been written, however, without the effort of many other peoples who shared their knowledge with me, mostly through free resources starting from BBSs during the 80s, sites and blogs, as well as the wide availability of source code.

Thus, all the entries in this blog, all posts and code snippets, are released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). I strongly believe that shared knowledge, in every field, is the only way to achieve real progress.

_“We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.”_ (Bernard of Chartres)

## About errors

Since english is not my mothertongue you will likely find horrible and disgraceful language errors.

Since computer science is my main occupation you will likely find every sort of absurdity.

Each error is a lesson... if someone corrects you. So please notify me any mistake or oversight.
