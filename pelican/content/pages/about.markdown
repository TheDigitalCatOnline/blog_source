Title: About

_“We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.”_ (Bernard of Chartres)

## About this blog

This blog was born in 2013 out of my desire to publish a series of old articles on concurrent programming I wrote at the university. Those articles summarize some knowledge acquired during the operating systems class and are the oldest ones you can find here. The blog then evolved following my interests and contains mostly posts about Python, with some digressions on other languages and technologies such as Erlang, Scala, Clojure, AMQP.

Cats are curious and inquisitive animals. I am a digital cat.

## License

The content of this blog is the result of my studies and investigations into several computer science topics. Nothing could ever have been written, however, without the effort of many other peoples who shared their knowledge with me, mostly through free resources starting from BBSs during the 80s, then forums, sites and blogs, as well as the wide availability of source code.

All entries in this blog (posts and code snippets), are thus released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0). I strongly believe that shared knowledge, in every field, is the only way to achieve real progress.

## About errors

Since computer science is my main occupation you will likely find every sort of absurdity in this blog.

Each error is a lesson... if someone corrects you. So please notify me any mistake or oversight you can spot.
