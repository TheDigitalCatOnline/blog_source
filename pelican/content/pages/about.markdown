Title: About

_“We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.”_ (Bernard of Chartres)

## About us

Call us software engineers, programmers, coders, geek, whatever.

Cats are curious and inquisitive animals. We are digital cats.

## About this blog

This blog was born in 2013 out of the desire of one of the authors to publish a series of old articles on concurrent programming he wrote at the university. Those articles summarize some knowledge acquired during the operating systems class and are the oldest ones you can find here.

Between 2013 and 2015 the blog was authored by a single person and contained mostly posts about Python, with some digressions on other languages and technologies such as Erlang, Scala, Clojure, AMQP. 

From 2016 the blog tries to become a multi-author site, keeping the original spirit: sharing knowledge. We'll see what comes of it.

## License

The content of this blog is the result of the studies and investigations of the authors into different computer science topics. Nothing could ever have been written, however, without the effort of many other peoples who shared their knowledge with us, mostly through free resources starting from BBSs during the 80s, then forums, sites and blogs, as well as the wide availability of source code.

All entries in this blog (posts and code snippets), thus, are released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). We strongly believe that shared knowledge, in every field, is the only way to achieve real progress.
