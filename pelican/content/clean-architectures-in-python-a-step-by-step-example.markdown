Summary: How to create software that can be easily changed and adapted, following the clean architecture principles

In 2015 I was introduced by my friend [Roberto Ciatti](https://github.com/gekorob) to the concept of Clean Architecture, as it is called by Robert Martin. The well-known Uncle Bob talks a lot about this concept at conferences and wrote some very interesting posts about it. What he calls "Clean Architecture" is a way of structuring a software system, a set of consideration (more than strict rules) about the different layers and the role of the actors in it.

As he clearly states in a post aptly titled [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), the idea behind this design is not new, being built on a set of concepts that have been pushed by many software engineers over the last 3 decades. One of the first implementations may be found in the Boundary-Control-Entity model proposed by Ivar Jacobson in his masterpiece "Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach" published in 1992, but Martin lists other more recent versions of this architecture.

I will not repeat here what he had already explained better than I can do, so I will just point out some resources you may check to start exploring these concepts:

* [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) a post by Robert Martin that concisely describes the goals of the architecture. It also lists resources that describe similar architectures.
* [The Open Closed Principle](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/12/TheOpenClosedPrinciple.html) a post by Robert Martin not strictly correlated with the Clean Architecture concept but important for the separation concept.
* Hakka Labs: Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin - [Architecture: The Lost Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNIttd87xs) a video of Robert Martin from Hakka Labs.
* [DDD & Testing Strategy](http://www.taimila.com/blog/ddd-and-testing-strategy/) by Lauri Taimila
* [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Architecture-Robert-C-Martin-x/dp/0134494164/ref=la_B000APG87E_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1479146201&sr=1-3) by Robert Martin, published by Prentice Hall.
