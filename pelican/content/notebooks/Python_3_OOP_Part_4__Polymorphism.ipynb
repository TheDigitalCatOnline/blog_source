    "## Good Morning, Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "The term _polymorphism_, in the OOP lingo, refers to the ability of an object to adapt the code to the type of the data it is processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism has two major applications in an OOP language. The first is that an object may provide different implementations of one of its methods depending on the type of the input parameters. The second is that code written for a given type of data may be used on data with a derived type, i.e. methods understand the class hierarchy of a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python polymorphism is one of the key concepts, and we can say that it is a built-in feature. Let us deal with it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you know that in Python the type of a variable is not explicitly declared. Beware that this does not mean that Python variables are _untyped_. On the contrary, everything in Python has a type, it just happens that the type is implicitly assigned. If you remember the last paragraph of the previous post, I stated that in Python variables are just pointers (using a C-like nomenclature), in other words they just tell the language _where_ in memory a variable has been stored. What is stored at that address is not a business of the variable."

    "This little example shows a lot about the Python typing system. The variable `a` is not statically declared, after all it can contain only one type of data: a memory address. When we assign the number 5 to it, Python stores in `a` the _address_ of the number 5 (`0x83fe540` in my case, but your result will be different). The `type()` built-in function is smart enough to understand that we are not asking about the type of `a` (which is always a reference), but about the type of the content. When you store another value in `a`, the string `'five'`, Python shamelessly replaces the previous content of the variable with the new address.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, thanks to the reference system, Python type system is both _strong_ and _dynamic_. The exact definition of those two concepts is not universal, so if you are interested be ready to dive into a broad matter. However, in Python, the meaning of those two words is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* type system is _strong_ because everything has a well-defined type that you can check with the `type()` built-in function\n",
    "* type system is _dynamic_ since the type of a variable is not explicitly declared, but changes with the content\n",

    "Pretty straightforward, isn't it? Well, if you come from a statically compiled language such as C or C++ you should be at least puzzled. What is `a`? I mean: what type of data does it contain? Moreover, how can Python know what it is returning if there is no type specification?\n",

    "\n",
    "This is exactly the problem that polymorphism wants to solve. We want to describe an action regardless of the type of objects, and this is what we do when we talk among humans. When you describe how to move an object by pushing it, you may explain it using a box, but you expect the person you are addressing to be able to repeat the action even if you need to move a pen, or a book, or a bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main strategies you can apply to get code that performs the same operation regardless of the input types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is to cover all cases, and this is a typical approach of procedural languages. If you need to sum two numbers that can be integers, float or complex, you just need to write three `sum()` functions, one bound to the integer type, the second bound to the float type and the third bound to the complex type, and to have some language feature that takes charge of choosing the correct implementation depending on the input type. This logic can be implemented by a compiler (if the language is statically typed) or by a runtime environment (if the language is dynamically typed) and is the approach chosen by C++. The disadvantage of this solution is that it requires the programmer to forecast all the possible situations: what if I need to sum an integer with a float? What if I need to sum two lists? (Please note that C++ is not so poorly designed, and the operator overloading technique allows to manage such cases, but the base polymorphism strategy of that language is the one exposed here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy, the one implemented by Python, is simply to require the input objects to solve the problem for you. In other words you _ask the data itself to perform the operation_, reversing the problem. Instead of writing a bunch of functions that sum all the possible types in every possible combination you just write one function that requires the input data to sum, trusting that they know how to do it. Does it sound complex? It is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the Python implementation of the `+` operator. When we write `c = a + b`, Python actually executes `c = a.__add__(b)`. As you can see the sum operation is delegated to the first input variable. So if we write"

    "So, to sum up what we discovered until here, I would say that _Python polymorphism is based on delegation_. In the following sections we will talk about the [EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp) Python principle, and you will see that the delegation principle is somehow ubiquitous in this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real-life concept that polymorphism wants to bring into a programming language is the ability to walk the class hierarchy, that is _to run code on specialized types_. This is a complex sentence to say something we are used to do every day, and an example will clarify the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know how to open a door, it is something you learned in your early years. Under an OOP point of view you are an object (sorry, no humiliation intended) which is capable of interacting with a wood rectangle rotating on hinges. When you can open a door, however, you can also open a window, which, after all, is a specialized type of wood-rectangle-with-hinges, hopefully with some glass in it too. You are also able to open the car door, which is also a specialized type (this one is a mix between a standard door and a window). This shows that, once you know how to interact with the most generic type (basic door) you can also interact with specialized types (window, car door) as soon as they act like the ancestor type (e.g. as soon as they rotate on hinges).\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly translates into OOP languages: polymorphism requires that _code written for a given type may also be run on derived types_. For example, a list (a generic list object, not a Python one) that can contain \"numbers\" shall be able to accept integers because they _are_ numbers. The list could specify an ordering operation which requires the numbers to be able to compare each other. So, as soon as integers specify a way to compare each other they can be inserted into the list and ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statically compiled languages shall provide specific language features to implement this part of the polymorphism concept. In C++, for example, the language needs to introduce the concept of pointer compatibility between parent and child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there is no need to provide special language features to implement subtype polymorphism. As we already discovered Python functions accept any variable without checking the type and rely on the variable itself to provide the correct methods. But you already know that a subtype must provide the methods of the parent type, either redefining them or through implicit delegation, so as you can see Python implements subtype polymorphism from the very beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is one of the most important things to understand when working with this language. Python is not really interested in the actual type of the variables you are working with. It is interested in how those variables act, that is it just wants the variable _to provide the right methods_. So, if you come from statically typed languages, you need to make a special effort to think about _acting like_ instead of _being_. This is what we called \"duck typing\".\n",
