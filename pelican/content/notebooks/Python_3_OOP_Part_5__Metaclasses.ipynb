That method recognizes that no instance has been created (`Singleton.instance` is `None`) and acts just like any standard class does.

The class may also define a destructor, which is called when the object is destroyed. In languages without a garbage collection mechanism such as C++ the destructor shall be carefully designed. In Python the destructor may be defined through the `__del__()` method, but it is hardly used.\n",

Anyway, `__init__()` will be called only if you return an instance of the container class. Please also note that `__new__()`, unlike `__init__()`, accepts the class as its first parameter.
