Summary: The updated index of posts about 99 Scala Problems

I decided to learn [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). I looked for some good exercises for Scala programmers and found [S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/), and since writing about things helps me learning them I am going to write a post for each problem I manage to solve.

The official site provides solutions for the problems, so my solutions will obviously be influenced by those, when not the same.

**CAVEAT**: I am a beginner so what I state in the following posts may be inaccurate and sometimes wrong. Please submit an issue on the blog [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lgiordani/lgiordani.github.com/issues) page.

This is the index of the problems I already discussed. I kept the original title and difficulty ranking (asterisks)
